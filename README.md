######## DESCRIPTION

A Voxel Engine in .NET using Direct3D11 with SlimDX. 

This project was created with the objective of having a test bed for experimenting with the advantages and disadvantages of this Engine kind. Objectives of this project are:

- Create an API for an Engine that is easy to use and extend.
- Experiment with modern GPU capabilities and how they can benefit an engine of this kind, e.g. Geometry Shaders.
- Experiment with procedural generation of terrain.
- A discrete terrain is a great playground for testing out artificial intelligence algorithms and concepts.
- Voxel engines can teach the combination of materials (such as Minecraft) or help practice team work (collaborative construction).
